## Overview

This project forecasts daily sales for Rossmann stores using historical data, store metadata, and engineered features. We employ the Random Forest Regression and XGBoost regression models to capture complex patterns and improve predictive accuracy. This README provides a detailed guide on how to set up and run the project.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to accurately predict daily sales for Rossmann stores. By analyzing historical sales data and incorporating various features such as promotions, holidays, and store metadata, we aim to build a robust model that provides reliable sales forecasts.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize the dataset using libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.
- **Modeling**: Implement Random Forest and XGBoost models for regression.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance through systematic tuning.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful plots to understand model predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **XGBoost**: For gradient boosting and model optimization.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle competition "Rossmann Store Sales." The dataset includes:

- **Train.csv**: Historical sales data.
- **Store.csv**: Metadata for each store.
- **Test.csv**: Data for which predictions are to be made.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SJ2005-code/rossmann_sales_forecast.git
   cd rossmann_sales_forecast
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will load the data, train the models, and output the predictions. You can adjust parameters in the `config.py` file to customize the execution.

## Models

### Random Forest Regression

The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate prediction. This model is robust against overfitting and works well with non-linear data.

### XGBoost Regression

XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It provides a parallel tree boosting that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Both models benefit from hyperparameter tuning to improve performance. We utilize techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search to find the optimal settings.

## Results

The models' performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results indicate that both models provide accurate forecasts, with XGBoost generally outperforming Random Forest in terms of predictive accuracy.

### Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to help understand the data and model predictions. These plots illustrate trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of different features on sales.
